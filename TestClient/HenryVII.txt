"Good morrow, and well met.",
"I thank your Grace, Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer Of what I saw there.",
"An untimely ague Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when Those suns of glory, those two lights of men, Met in the vale of Andren.",
"'Twixt Guynes and Arde- I was then present, saw them salute on horseback; Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung In their embracement, as they grew together; Which had they, what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd   Such a compounded one?",
"All the whole time I was my chamber's prisoner.",
"Then you lost The view of earthly glory; men might say, Till this time pomp was single, but now married To one above itself.",
"O, you go far!",
"As I belong to worship, and affect In honour honesty, the tract of ev'rything Would by a good discourser lose some life Which action's self was tongue to.",
"Who did guide- I mean, who set the body and the limbs Of this great sport together, as you guess?",
"One, certes, that promises no element In such a business.",
"I pray you, who, my lord?",
"All this was ord'red by the good discretion Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.",
"The devil speed him!",
"Surely, sir, There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends; For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon For high feats done to th' crown, neither allied To eminent assistants, but spider-like, Out of his self-drawing web, 'a gives us note The force of his own merit makes his way- A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys   A place next to the King.",
"I cannot tell What heaven hath given him-let some graver eye Pierce into that; but I can see his pride Peep through each part of him.",
"Why the devil, Upon this French going out, took he upon him- Without the privity o' th' King-t' appoint Who should attend on him?",
"I do know Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have By this so sicken'd their estates that never   They shall abound as formerly.",
"O, many Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em For this great journey.",
"Grievingly I think The peace between the French and us not values The cost that did conclude it.",
"Every man, After the hideous storm that follow'd, was A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke Into a general prophecy-that this tempest, Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded The sudden breach on't.",
"Which is budded out; For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd Our merchants' goods at Bordeaux.",
"Is it therefore Th' ambassador is silenc'd?",
"Marry, is't.",
"A proper tide of a peace, and purchas'd At a superfluous rate!",
"Why, all this business Our reverend Cardinal carried.",
"Like it your Grace, The state takes notice of the private difference Betwixt you and the Cardinal.",
"The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor?",
"Here, so please you.",
"Is he in person ready?",
"Ay, please your Grace.",
"Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham shall lessen this big look.",
"This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best Not wake him in his slumber.",
"What, are you chaf'd?",
"I read in's looks Matter against me, and his eye revil'd Me as his abject object.",
"Stay, my lord, And let your reason with your choler question What 'tis you go about.",
"I'll to the King, And from a mouth of honour quite cry down This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim There's difference in no persons.",
"Be advis'd:   Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot That it do singe yourself.",
"Sir, I am thankful to you, and I'll go along By your prescription; but this top-proud fellow- Whom from the flow of gan I name not, but From sincere motions, by intelligence, And proofs as clear as founts in July when We see each grain of gravel-I do know To be corrupt and treasonous.",
"Say not treasonous.",
"To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong  As shore of rock.",
"Faith, and so it did.",
"Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal The articles o' th' combination drew As himself pleas'd; and they were ratified As he cried 'Thus let be' to as much end As give a crutch to th' dead.",
"I am sorry To hear this of him, and could wish he were Something mistaken in't.",
"No, not a syllable: I do pronounce him in that very shape He shall appear in proof.",
"Your office, sergeant: execute it.",
"Sir, My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I Arrest thee of high treason, in the name Of our most sovereign King.",
"Lo you, my lord, The net has fall'n upon me!",
"I am sorry To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on The business present; 'tis his Highness' pleasure You shall to th' Tower.",
"It will help nothing To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me Which makes my whit'st part black.",
"Nay, he must bear you company.",
"As the Duke said, The will of heaven be done, and the King's pleasure By me obey'd.",
"Here is warrant from The King t' attach Lord Montacute and the bodies Of the Duke's confessor, John de la Car, One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor-",
"So, so!",
"A monk o' th' Chartreux.",
"O, Nicholas Hopkins?",
"He.",
"My surveyor is false.",
"My life itself, and the best heart of it, Thanks you for this great care; I stood i' th' level Of a full-charg'd confederacy, and give thanks To you that chok'd it.",
"Nay, we must longer kneel: I am suitor.",
"Arise, and take place by us.",
"Thank your Majesty.",
"Lady mine, proceed.",
"I am solicited, not by a few, And those of true condition, that your subjects Are in great grievance: there have been commissions Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart Of all their loyalties; wherein, although, My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches Most bitterly on you as putter-on   Of these exactions, yet the King our master- Whose honour Heaven shield from soil!",
"Not almost appears- It doth appear; for, upon these taxations, The clothiers all, not able to maintain The many to them 'longing, have put of The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger And lack of other means, in desperate manner Daring th' event to th' teeth, are all in uproar, And danger serves among them.",
"Taxation!",
"Please you, sir, I know but of a single part in aught   Pertains to th' state, and front but in that file Where others tell steps with me.",
"No, my lord!",
"Still exaction!",
"I am much too venturous In tempting of your patience, but am bold'ned Under your promis'd pardon.",
"By my life, This is against our pleasure.",
"And for me, I have no further gone in this than by A single voice; and that not pass'd me but By learned approbation of the judges.",
"Things done well And with a care exempt themselves from fear: Things done without example, in their issue Are to be fear'd.",
"[Aside to the SECRETARY]  A word with you.",
"I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham Is run in your displeasure.",
"It grieves many.",
"Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you, Most like a careful subject, have collected   Out of the Duke of Buckingham.",
"Speak freely.",
"First, it was usual with him-every day It would infect his speech-that if the King Should without issue die, he'll carry it so To make the sceptre his.",
"Please your Highness, note This dangerous conception in this point: Not friended by his wish, to your high person His will is most malignant, and it stretches Beyond you to your friends.",
"My learn'd Lord Cardinal, Deliver all with charity.",
"Speak on.",
"He was brought to this By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton.",
"What was that Henton?",
"Sir, a Chartreux friar, His confessor, who fed him every minute With words of sovereignty.",
"How know'st thou this?",
"Not long before your Highness sped to France, The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand What was the speech among the Londoners Concerning the French journey.",
"If I know you well, You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your office On the complaint o' th' tenants.",
"Let him on.",
"On my soul, I'll speak but truth.",
"Ha!",
"I can, my liege.",
"Proceed.",
"Being at Greenwich, After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke About Sir William Bulmer-",
"I remember Of such a time: being my sworn servant, The Duke retain'd him his.",
"'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed- As to the Tower I thought-I would have play'd The part my father meant to act upon   Th' usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury, Made suit to come in's presence, which if granted, As he made semblance of his duty, would Have put his knife into him.",
"A giant traitor!",
"Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom, And this man out of prison?",
"God mend all!",
"There's something more would out of thee: what say'st?",
"After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,' He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger, Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes, He did discharge a horrible oath, whose tenour Was, were he evil us'd, he would outgo His father by as much as a performance Does an irresolute purpose.",
"There's his period, To sheath his knife in us.",
"Is't possible the spells of France should juggle Men into such strange mysteries?",
"New customs, Though they be never so ridiculous, Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.",
"As far as I see, all the good our English Have got by the late voyage is but merely A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones; For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly Their very noses had been counsellors To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.",
"They have all new legs, and lame ones.",
"Death!",
"Faith, my lord, I hear of none but the new proclamation That's clapp'd upon the court gate.",
"What is't for?",
"The reformation of our travell'd gallants, That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.",
"I am glad 'tis there.",
"They must either, For so run the conditions, leave those remnants Of fool and feather that they got in France, With all their honourable points of ignorance Pertaining thereunto-as fights and fireworks;   Abusing better men than they can be, Out of a foreign wisdom-renouncing clean The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings, Short blist'red breeches, and those types of travel And understand again like honest men, Or pack to their old playfellows.",
"'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases Are grown so catching.",
"What a loss our ladies Will have of these trim vanities!",
"Ay, marry, There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies.",
"The devil fiddle 'em!",
"Well said, Lord Sandys; Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.",
"No, my lord, Nor shall not while I have a stamp.",
"Sir Thomas, Whither were you a-going?",
"To the Cardinal's; Your lordship is a guest too.",
"O, 'tis true; This night he makes a supper, and a great one, To many lords and ladies; there will be The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.",
"That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed, A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us; His dews fall everywhere.",
"No doubt he's noble; He had a black mouth that said other of him.",
"He may, my lord; has wherewithal.",
"True, they are so; But few now give so great ones.",
"I am your lordship's.",
"Ladies, a general welcome from his Grace Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates To fair content and you.",
"You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.",
"Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these Should find a running banquet ere they rested I think would better please 'em.",
"O that your lordship were but now confessor To one or two of these!",
"I would I were; They should find easy penance.",
"Faith, how easy?",
"As easy as a down bed would afford it.",
"Sweet ladies, will it please you sit?",
"By my faith, And thank your lordship.",
"Was he mad, sir?",
"O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too.",
"Well said, my lord.",
"For my little cure, Let me alone.",
"Y'are welcome, my fair guests.",
"Your Grace is noble.",
"My Lord Sandys, I am beholding to you.",
"The red wine first must rise In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em Talk us to silence.",
"You are a merry gamester, My Lord Sandys.",
"Yes, if I make my play.",
"You cannot show me.",
"I told your Grace they would talk anon.",
"What's that?",
"Look out there, some of ye.",
"What warlike voice, And to what end, is this?",
"How now!",
"A noble troop of strangers- For so they seem.",
"Good Lord Chamberlain, Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue; And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty Shall shine at full upon them.",
"Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd To tell your Grace, that, having heard by fame Of this so noble and so fair assembly This night to meet here, they could do no less, Out of the great respect they bear to beauty, But leave their flocks and, under your fair conduct, Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat An hour of revels with 'em.",
"Say, Lord Chamberlain, They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em   A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.",
"The fairest hand I ever touch'd!",
"My lord!",
"Your Grace?",
"Pray tell 'em thus much from me: There should be one amongst 'em, by his person, More worthy this place than myself; to whom, If I but knew him, with my love and duty I would surrender it.",
"I will, my lord.",
"What say they?",
"Such a one, they all confess, There is indeed; which they would have your Grace Find out, and he will take it.",
"Let me see, then.",
"[Unmasking]  Ye have found him, Cardinal.",
"I am glad Your Grace is grown so pleasant.",
"My Lord Chamberlain, Prithee come hither: what fair lady's that?",
"An't please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's The Viscount Rochford-one of her Highness' women.",
"By heaven, she is a dainty one.",
"Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready I' th' privy chamber?",
"Yes, my lord.",
"Your Grace, I fear, with dancing is a little heated.",
"I fear, too much.",
"There's fresher air, my lord, In the next chamber.",
"Lead in your ladies, ev'ry one.",
"Whither away so fast?",
"O, God save ye!",
"I'll save you That labour, sir.",
"Were you there?",
"Yes, indeed, was I.",
"Pray, speak what has happen'd.",
"You may guess quickly what.",
"Is he found guilty?",
"Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.",
"I am sorry for't.",
"So are a number more.",
"But, pray, how pass'd it?",
"I'll tell you in a little.",
"That was he That fed him with his prophecies?",
"The same.",
"After all this, how did he bear him-self",
"When he was brought again to th' bar to hear His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd With such an agony he sweat extremely, And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty; But he fell to himself again, and sweetly In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.",
"I do not think he fears death.",
"Sure, he does not; He never was so womanish; the cause He may a little grieve at.",
"Certainly The Cardinal is the end of this.",
"'Tis likely, By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder, Then deputy of Ireland, who remov'd, Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too, Lest he should help his father.",
"That trick of state   Was a deep envious one.",
"At his return No doubt he will requite it.",
"All the commons Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience, Wish him ten fathom deep: this Duke as much They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham, The mirror of all courtesy-",
"Stay there, sir, And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.",
"Let's stand close, and behold him.",
"All good people, You that thus far have come to pity me, Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.",
"I do beseech your Grace, for charity, If ever any malice in your heart Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.",
"Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you As I would be forgiven.",
"To th' water side I must conduct your Grace; Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux, Who undertakes you to your end.",
"Prepare there; The Duke is coming; see the barge be ready; And fit it with such furniture as suits The greatness of his person.",
"Nay, Sir Nicholas, Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.",
"O, this is full of pity!",
"If the Duke be guiltless, 'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling Of an ensuing evil, if it fall, Greater than this.",
"Good angels keep it from us!",
"This secret is so weighty, 'twill require A strong faith to conceal it.",
"Let me have it; I do not talk much.",
"I am confident.",
"Yes, but it held not; For when the King once heard it, out of anger He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight To stop the rumour and allay those tongues That durst disperse it.",
"But that slander, sir, Is found a truth now; for it grows again Fresher than e'er it was, and held for certain The King will venture at it.",
"'Tis the Cardinal; And merely to revenge him on the Emperor For not bestowing on him at his asking   The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purpos'd.",
"I think you have hit the mark; but is't That she should feel the smart of this?",
"'Tis woeful.",
"'My lord, 'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnish'd.",
"Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.",
"Good day to both your Graces.",
"How is the King employ'd?",
"I left him private, Full of sad thoughts and troubles.",
"What's the cause?",
"It seems the marriage with his brother's wife Has crept too near his conscience.",
"No, his conscience Has crept too near another lady.",
"'Tis so; This is the Cardinal's doing; the King-Cardinal, That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune, Turns what he list.",
"Pray God he do!",
"How holily he works in all his business!",
"Heaven keep me from such counsel!",
"And free us from his slavery.",
"We had need pray, and heartily, for our deliverance; Or this imperious man will work us an From princes into pages.",
"For me, my lords, I love him not, nor fear him-there's my creed; As I am made without him, so I'll stand, If the King please; his curses and his blessings Touch me alike; th' are breath I not believe in.",
"Let's in; And with some other business put the King From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him.",
"Excuse me, The King has sent me otherwhere; besides, You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him.",
"Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.",
"How sad he looks; sure, he is much afflicted.",
"Who's there, ha?",
"Pray God he be not angry.",
"Who's there, I say?",
"A gracious king that pardons all offences Malice ne'er meant.",
"Ye are too bold.",
"Sir, you cannot.",
"[To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]  We are busy; go.",
"[Aside to SUFFOLK]  This priest has no pride in him!",
"[Aside to NORFOLK]  Not to speak of!",
"[Aside to SUFFOLK]  If it do, I'll venture one have-at-him.",
"[Aside to NORFOLK]  I another.",
"Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom Above all princes, in committing freely Your scruple to the voice of Christendom.",
"And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome, And thank the holy conclave for their loves.",
"Your Grace must needs deserve an strangers' loves, You are so noble.",
"Two equal men.",
"I know your Majesty has always lov'd her So dear in heart not to deny her that   A woman of less place might ask by law- Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.",
"Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour To him that does best.",
"[Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand: much You are the King's now.",
"[Aside to WOLSEY]  But to be commanded For ever by your Grace, whose hand has rais'd me.",
"Come hither, Gardiner.",
"My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace In this man's place before him?",
"Yes, he was.",
"Was he not held a learned man?",
"Yes, surely.",
"Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then, Even of yourself, Lord Cardinal.",
"How!",
"They will not stick to say you envied him And, fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous, Kept him a foreign man still; which so griev'd him That he ran mad and died.",
"Heav'n's peace be with him!",
"Deliver this with modesty to th' Queen.",
"Not for that neither.",
"Hearts of most hard temper Melt and lament for her.",
"O, God's will!",
"Alas, poor lady!",
"So much the more Must pity drop upon her.",
"Our content Is our best having.",
"By my troth and maidenhead, I would not be a queen.",
"Beshrew me, I would, And venture maidenhead for 't; and so would you, For all this spice of your hypocrisy.",
"Nay, good troth.",
"Yes, troth and troth.",
"No, not for all the riches under heaven.",
"'Tis strange: a threepence bow'd would hire me, Old as I am, to queen it.",
"No, in truth.",
"Then you are weakly made.",
"How you do talk!",
"In faith, for little England You'd venture an emballing.",
"Good morrow, ladies.",
"My good lord, Not your demand; it values not your asking.",
"It was a gentle business and becoming The action of good women; there is hope All will be well.",
"Now, I pray God, amen!",
"You bear a gentle mind, and heav'nly blessings Follow such creatures.",
"I do not know What kind of my obedience I should tender; More than my all is nothing, nor my prayers Are not words duly hallowed, nor my wishes More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes Are all I can return.",
"Lady, I shall not fail t' approve the fair conceit The King hath of you.",
"My honour'd lord!",
"Why, this it is: see, see!",
"This is strange to me.",
"How tastes it?",
"Come, you are pleasant.",
"With your theme I could O'ermount the lark.",
"Good lady, Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy, And leave me out on't.",
"What do you think me?",
"Whilst our commission from Rome is read, Let silence be commanded.",
"What's the need?",
"Be't so; proceed.",
"Say 'Henry King of England, come into the court.",
"Henry King of England, &c.",
"Here.",
"Say 'Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.",
"Katharine Queen of England, &c.",
"Sir, I desire you do me right and justice, And to bestow your pity on me; for I am a most poor woman and a stranger, Born out of your dominions, having here No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance Of equal friendship and proceeding.",
"You have here, lady, And of your choice, these reverend fathers-men Of singular integrity and learning, Yea, the elect o' th' land, who are assembled To plead your cause.",
"His Grace Hath spoken well and justly; therefore, madam, It's fit this royal session do proceed And that, without delay, their arguments Be now produc'd and heard.",
"Lord Cardinal, To you I speak.",
"Your pleasure, madam?",
"Sir, I am about to weep; but, thinking that We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain The daughter of a king, my drops of tears I'll turn to sparks of fire.",
"Be patient yet.",
"I Will, when you are humble; nay, before Or God will punish me.",
"I do profess You speak not like yourself, who ever yet Have stood to charity and display'd th' effects Of disposition gentle and of wisdom O'ertopping woman's pow'r.",
"My lord, my lord, I am a simple woman, much too weak T' oppose your cunning.",
"The Queen is obstinate, Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and Disdainful to be tried by't; 'tis not well.",
"Call her again.",
"Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.",
"Madam, you are call'd back.",
"What need you note it?",
"Go thy ways, Kate.",
"Most gracious sir, In humblest manner I require your Highness That it shall please you to declare in hearing Of all these ears-for where I am robb'd and bound, There must I be unloos'd, although not there At once and fully satisfied-whether ever I Did broach this business to your Highness, or Laid any scruple in your way which might Induce you to the question on't, or ever Have to you, but with thanks to God for such A royal lady, spake one the least word that might Be to the prejudice of her present state, Or touch of her good person?",
"My Lord Cardinal, I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour, I free you from't.",
"Very well, my liege.",
"I have spoke long; be pleas'd yourself to say How far you satisfied me.",
"So please your Highness, The question did at first so stagger me- Bearing a state of mighty moment in't And consequence of dread-that I committed The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt,   And did entreat your Highness to this course Which you are running here.",
"I then mov'd you, My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave To make this present summons.",
"So please your Highness, The Queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness That we adjourn this court till further day; Meanwhile must be an earnest motion   Made to the Queen to call back her appeal She intends unto his Holiness.",
"[Aside]  I may perceive These cardinals trifle with me.",
"Take thy lute, wench.",
"How now?",
"An't please your Grace, the two great Cardinals Wait in the presence.",
"Would they speak with me?",
"They will'd me say so, madam.",
"Pray their Graces To come near.",
"Peace to your Highness!",
"Your Graces find me here part of housewife; I would be all, against the worst may happen.",
"May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw Into your private chamber, we shall give you The full cause of our coming.",
"Speak it here; There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience, Deserves a corner.",
"Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina",
"O, good my lord, no Latin!",
"Noble lady, I am sorry my integrity should breed, And service to his Majesty and you, So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant We come not by the way of accusation To taint that honour every good tongue blesses, Nor to betray you any way to sorrow- You have too much, good lady; but to know How you stand minded in the weighty difference Between the King and you, and to deliver, Like free and honest men, our just opinions And comforts to your cause.",
"Most honour'd madam, My Lord of York, out of his noble nature, Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace, Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure Both of his truth and him-which was too far- Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace, His service and his counsel.",
"[Aside]  To betray me.",
"Madam, you wrong the King's love with these fears; Your hopes and friends are infinite.",
"In England But little for my profit; can you think, lords, That any Englishman dare give me counsel?",
"I would your Grace Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.",
"How, sir?",
"Put your main cause into the King's protection; He's loving and most gracious.",
"He tells you rightly.",
"Ye tell me what ye wish for both-my ruin.",
"Your rage mistakes us.",
"The more shame for ye; holy men I thought ye, Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues; But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.",
"Madam, this is a mere distraction; You turn the good we offer into envy.",
"Ye turn me into nothing.",
"Your fears are worse.",
"Have I liv'd thus long-let me speak myself, Since virtue finds no friends-a wife, a true one?",
"Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.",
"My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty, To give up willingly that noble title Your master wed me to: nothing but death Shall e'er divorce my dignities.",
"Pray hear me.",
"Would I had never trod this English earth, Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!",
"If your Grace Could but be brought to know our ends are honest, You'd feel more comfort.",
"Madam, you'll find it so.",
"Do what ye will my lords; and pray If I have us'd myself unmannerly; You know I am a woman, lacking wit To make a seemly answer to such persons.",
"If you will now unite in your complaints And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal Cannot stand under them: if you omit The offer of this time, I cannot promise But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces With these you bear already.",
"I am joyful To meet the least occasion that may give me Remembrance of my father-in-law, the Duke, To be reveng'd on him.",
"Which of the peers Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least Strangely neglected?",
"My lords, you speak your pleasures.",
"O, fear him not!",
"Sir, I should be glad to hear such news as this Once every hour.",
"Believe it, this is true: In the divorce his contrary proceedings Are all unfolded; wherein he appears As I would wish mine enemy.",
"How came   His practices to light?",
"Most Strangely.",
"O, how, how?",
"The Cardinal's letters to the Pope miscarried, And came to th' eye o' th' King; wherein was read How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness To stay the judgment o' th' divorce; for if It did take place, 'I do' quoth he 'perceive My king is tangled in affection to A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.",
"Has the King this?",
"Believe it.",
"Will this work?",
"The King in this perceives him how he coasts And hedges his own way.",
"Would he had!",
"May you be happy in your wish, my lord!",
"Now, all my joy Trace the conjunction!",
"My amen to't!",
"An men's!",
"There's order given for her coronation; Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left To some ears unrecounted.",
"But will the King Digest this letter of the Cardinal's?",
"Marry, amen!",
"No, no; There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose Will make this sting the sooner.",
"Now, God incense him, And let him cry 'Ha!",
"But, my lord, When returns Cranmer?",
"He is return'd in his opinions; which Have satisfied the King for his divorce, Together with all famous colleges Almost in Christendom.",
"This same Cranmer's A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain In the King's business.",
"He has; and we shall see him   For it an archbishop.",
"So I hear.",
"'Tis so.",
"Observe, observe, he's moody.",
"The packet, Cromwell, Gave't you the King?",
"To his own hand, in's bedchamber.",
"Look'd he o' th' inside of the paper?",
"Presently He did unseal them; and the first he view'd, He did it with a serious mind; a heed Was in his countenance.",
"Is he ready To come abroad?",
"I think by this he is.",
"Leave me awhile.",
"He's discontented.",
"May be he hears the King Does whet his anger to him.",
"Sharp enough, Lord, for thy justice!",
"[Aside]  The late Queen's gentlewoman, a knight's To be her mistress' mistress!",
"He is vex'd at something.",
"I would 'twere something that would fret the string, The master-cord on's heart!",
"The King, the King!",
"What piles of wealth hath he accumulated To his own portion!",
"My lord, we have Stood here observing him.",
"It may well be There is a mutiny in's mind.",
"It's heaven's will; Some spirit put this paper in the packet To bless your eye withal.",
"If we did think His contemplation were above the earth   And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still dwell in his musings; but I am afraid His thinkings are below the moon, not worth His serious considering.",
"Heaven forgive me!",
"Good, my lord, You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory Of your best graces in your mind; the which You were now running o'er.",
"Sir, For holy offices I have a time; a time To think upon the part of business which I bear i' th' state; and nature does require   Her times of preservation, which perforce I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal, Must give my tendance to.",
"You have said well.",
"And ever may your Highness yoke together, As I will lend you cause, my doing well With my well saying!",
"'Tis well said again; And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well; And yet words are no deeds.",
"[Aside]  What should this mean?",
"[Aside]  The Lord increase this business!",
"Have I not made you The prime man of the state?",
"My sovereign, I confess your royal graces, Show'r'd on me daily, have been more than could My studied purposes requite; which went Beyond all man's endeavours.",
"Fairly answer'd!",
"I do profess That for your Highness' good I ever labour'd More than mine own; that am, have, and will be- Though all the world should crack their duty to you, And throw it from their soul; though perils did Abound as thick as thought could make 'em, and Appear in forms more horrid-yet my duty, As doth a rock against the chiding flood, Should the approach of this wild river break, And stand unshaken yours.",
"'Tis nobly spoken.",
"What should this mean?",
"Hear the King's pleasure, Cardinal, who commands you To render up the great seal presently Into our hands, and to confine yourself   To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's, Till you hear further from his Highness.",
"Stay: Where's your commission, lords?",
"Who dares cross 'em, Bearing the King's will from his mouth expressly?",
"Till I find more than will or words to do it- I mean your malice-know, officious lords, I dare and must deny it.",
"The King, that gave it.",
"It must be himself then.",
"Thou art a proud traitor, priest.",
"Proud lord, thou liest.",
"Thy ambition, Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law.",
"This, and all else   This talking lord can lay upon my credit, I answer is most false.",
"By my soul, Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou shouldst feel My sword i' the life-blood of thee else.",
"All goodness   Is poison to thy stomach.",
"Yes, that goodness Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one, Into your own hands, Cardinal, by extortion; The goodness of your intercepted packets You writ to th' Pope against the King; your goodness, Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.",
"How much, methinks, I could despise this man, But that I am bound in charity against it!",
"Those articles, my lord, are in the King's hand; But, thus much, they are foul ones.",
"So much fairer   And spotless shall mine innocence arise, When the King knows my truth.",
"This cannot save you.",
"Speak on, sir; I dare your worst objections.",
"I had rather want those than my head.",
"Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus' Was still inscrib'd; in which you brought the King To be your servant.",
"Then, that without the knowledge Either of King or Council, when you went   Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold To carry into Flanders the great seal.",
"Item, you sent a large commission To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude, Without the King's will or the state's allowance, A league between his Highness and Ferrara.",
"That out of mere ambition you have caus'd Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the King's coin.",
"Then, that you have sent innumerable substance, By what means got I leave to your own conscience, To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways You have for dignities, to the mere undoing Of all the kingdom.",
"O my lord, Press not a falling man too far!",
"I forgive him.",
"Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is- Because all those things you have done of late, By your power legatine within this kingdom, Fall into th' compass of a praemunire- That therefore such a writ be sued against you: To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements, Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be Out of the King's protection.",
"And so we'll leave you to your meditations How to live better.",
"So farewell to the little good you bear me.",
"I have no power to speak, sir.",
"What, amaz'd At my misfortunes?",
"How does your Grace?",
"Why, well; Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.",
"I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.",
"I hope I have.",
"The heaviest and the worst Is your displeasure with the King.",
"God bless him!",
"The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen Lord Chancellor in your place.",
"That's somewhat sudden.",
"That Cranmer is return'd with welcome, Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.",
"That's news indeed.",
"Last, that the Lady Anne,   Whom the King hath in secrecy long married, This day was view'd in open as his queen, Going to chapel; and the voice is now Only about her coronation.",
"There was the weight that pull'd me down.",
"O my lord, Must I then leave you?",
"Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear In all my miseries; but thou hast forc'd me, Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.",
"Good sir, have patience.",
"So I have.",
"Y'are well met once again.",
"So are you.",
"You come to take your stand here, and The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?",
"'Tis all my business.",
"'Tis very true.",
"'Tis well.",
"Never greater,   Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.",
"May I be bold to ask what that contains, That paper in your hand?",
"Yes; 'tis the list Of those that claim their offices this day, By custom of the coronation.",
"I thank you, sir; had I not known I should have been beholding to your paper.",
"That I can tell you too.",
"Alas, good lady!",
"A royal train, believe me.",
"Marquis Dorset; And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.",
"A bold brave gentleman.",
"'Tis the same-High Steward.",
"And that my Lord of Norfolk?",
"Yes.",
"[Looking on the QUEEN]  Heaven Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.",
"They that bear The cloth of honour over her are four barons Of the Cinque-ports.",
"Those men are happy; and so are all I take it she that carries up the train Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.",
"It is; and all the rest are countesses.",
"Their coronets say so.",
"No more of that.",
"Among the crowds i' th' Abbey, where a finger Could not be wedg'd in more; I am stifled With the mere rankness of their joy.",
"You saw The ceremony?",
"That I did.",
"How was it?",
"Well worth the seeing.",
"Good sir, speak it to us.",
"As well as I am able.",
"But what follow'd?",
"At length her Grace rose, and with Came to the altar, where she kneel'd, and saintlike Cast her fair eyes to heaven, and pray'd devoutly.",
"Sir, You must no more call it York Place: that's past: For since the Cardinal fell that title's lost.",
"I know it;   But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name Is fresh about me.",
"What two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the Queen?",
"Stokesly and Gardiner: the one of Winchester, Newly preferr'd from the King's secretary; The other, London.",
"He of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's, The virtuous Cranmer.",
"All the land knows that; However, yet there is no great breach.",
"Who may that be, I pray you?",
"Thomas Cromwell, A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly A worthy friend.",
"He will deserve more.",
"Yes, without all doubt.",
"You may command us, sir.",
"How does your Grace?",
"O Griffith, sick to death!",
"Yes, madam; but I think your Grace, Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.",
"Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.",
"Well, the voice goes, madam;   For after the stout Earl Northumberland Arrested him at York and brought him forward, As a man sorely tainted, to his answer, He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill He could not sit his mule.",
"Alas, poor man!",
"At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester, Lodg'd in the abbey; where the reverend abbot, With all his covent, honourably receiv'd him; To whom he gave these words: 'O father Abbot, An old man, broken with the storms of state, Is come to lay his weary bones among ye; Give him a little earth for charity!",
"So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!",
"Noble madam, Men's evil manners live in brass: their virtues We write in water.",
"Yes, good Griffith; I were malicious else.",
"This Cardinal, Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.",
"After my death I wish no other herald, No other speaker of my living actions, To keep mine honour from corruption, But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.",
"She is asleep.",
"Spirits of peace, where are ye?",
"Madam, we are here.",
"It is not you I call for.",
"None, madam.",
"No?",
"I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams Possess your fancy.",
"Bid the music leave, They are harsh and heavy to me.",
"Do you note How much her Grace is alter'd on the sudden?",
"She is going, wench.",
"Heaven comfort her!",
"An't like your Grace-",
"You are a saucy fellow.",
"You are to blame, Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness, To use so rude behaviour.",
"I humbly do entreat your Highness' pardon; My haste made me unmannerly.",
"Admit him entrance, Griffith; but this fellow Let me ne'er see again.",
"Madam, the same-your servant.",
"O, my Lord,   The times and titles now are alter'd strangely With me since first you knew me.",
"Noble lady, First, mine own service to your Grace; the next, The King's request that I would visit you, Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me Sends you his princely commendations And heartily entreats you take good comfort.",
"O my good lord, that comfort comes too late, 'Tis like a pardon after execution: That gentle physic, given in time, had cur'd me; But now I am past all comforts here, but prayers.",
"Madam, in good health.",
"So may he ever do!",
"No, madam.",
"Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver This to my lord the King.",
"Most willing, madam.",
"In which I have commended to his goodness The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter- The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!",
"By heaven, I will, Or let me lose the fashion of a man!",
"I thank you, honest lord.",
"It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?",
"It hath struck.",
"These should be hours for necessities, Not for delights; times to repair our nature With comforting repose, and not for us To waste these times.",
"Came you from the King, my lord?",
"I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero With the Duke of Suffolk.",
"I must to him too, Before he go to bed.",
"Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell.",
"My lord, I love you; And durst commend a secret to your ear Much weightier than this work.",
"The fruit she goes with I pray for heartily, that it may find Good time, and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas, I wish it grubb'd up now.",
"Methinks I could Cry thee amen; and yet my conscience says She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does Deserve our better wishes.",
"But, sir, sir- Hear me, Sir Thomas.",
"Now, sir, you speak of two The most remark'd i' th' kingdom.",
"Yes, yes, Sir Thomas, There are that dare; and I myself have ventur'd To speak my mind of him; and indeed this day, Sir-I may tell it you-I think I have Incens'd the lords o' th' Council, that he is- For so I know he is, they know he is- A most arch heretic, a pestilence   That does infect the land; with which they moved Have broken with the King, who hath so far Given ear to our complaint-of his great grace And princely care, foreseeing those fell mischiefs Our reasons laid before him-hath commanded To-morrow morning to the Council board He be convented.",
"Many good nights, my lord; I rest your servant.",
"Charles, I will play no more to-night; My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.",
"Sir, I did never win of you before.",
"But little, Charles; Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.",
"I could not personally deliver to her What you commanded me, but by her woman I sent your message; who return'd her thanks In the great'st humbleness, and desir'd your Highness Most heartily to pray for her.",
"What say'st thou, ha?",
"So said her woman; and that her suff'rance made Almost each pang a death.",
"Alas, good lady!",
"God safely quit her of her burden, and With gentle travail, to the gladding of Your Highness with an heir!",
"'Tis midnight, Charles; Prithee to bed; and in thy pray'rs remember Th' estate of my poor queen.",
"I wish your Highness A quiet night, and my good mistress will   Remember in my prayers.",
"Charles, good night.",
"Sir, I have brought my lord the Archbishop, As you commanded me.",
"Ha!",
"Ay, my good lord.",
"'Tis true.",
"He attends your Highness' pleasure.",
"Bring him to us.",
"[Aside]  This is about that which the bishop spake.",
"Avoid the gallery.",
"[Aside]  I am fearful-wherefore frowns he thus?",
"How now, my lord?",
"[Kneeling]  It is my duty T'attend your Highness' pleasure.",
"Pray you, arise, My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.",
"I humbly thank your Highness And am right glad to catch this good occasion Most throughly to be winnowed where my chaff And corn shall fly asunder; for I know There's none stands under more calumnious tongues Than I myself, poor man.",
"Stand up, good Canterbury; Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted In us, thy friend.",
"Most dread liege, The good I stand on is my truth and honesty; If they shall fail, I with mine enemies Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not, Being of those virtues vacant.",
"Know you not How your state stands i' th' world, with the whole world?",
"God and your Majesty Protect mine innocence, or I fall into The trap is laid for me!",
"Be of good cheer; They shall no more prevail than we give way to.",
"[Within]  Come back; what mean you?",
"I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring Will make my boldness manners.",
"Now, by thy looks I guess thy message.",
"Ay, ay, my liege; And of a lovely boy.",
"Lovell!",
"Sir?",
"Give her an hundred marks.",
"An hundred marks?",
"I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman That was sent to me from the Council pray'd me To make great haste.",
"Yes, my lord; But yet I cannot help you.",
"Why?",
"Your Grace must wait till you be call'd for.",
"So.",
"[Aside]  This is a piece of malice.",
"[Aside]  'Tis Butts, The King's physician; as he pass'd along, How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!",
"I'll show your Grace the strangest sight-",
"What's that, Butts?",
"I think your Highness saw this many a day.",
"Body a me, where is it?",
"There my lord:   The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury; Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants, Pages, and footboys.",
"Ha, 'tis he indeed.",
"Speak to the business, master secretary; Why are we met in council?",
"Please your honours, The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.",
"Has he had knowledge of it?",
"Yes.",
"Who waits there?",
"Without, my noble lords?",
"Yes.",
"My Lord Archbishop; And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.",
"Let him come in.",
"Your Grace may enter now.",
"My good Lord Archbishop, I am very sorry To sit here at this present, and behold That chair stand empty; but we all are men, In our own natures frail and capable Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us, Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little, Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains- For so we are inform'd-with new opinions, Divers and dangerous; which are heresies, And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.",
"Which reformation must be sudden too,   My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle, But stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur 'em Till they obey the manage.",
"My good lords, hitherto in all the progress Both of my life and office, I have labour'd, And with no little study, that my teaching And the strong course of my authority Might go one way, and safely; and the end Was ever to do well.",
"Nay, my lord, That cannot be; you are a councillor, And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.",
"My lord, because we have business of more moment, We will be short with you.",
"Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you; You are always my good friend; if your will pass,   I shall both find your lordship judge and juror, You are so merciful.",
"My lord, my lord, you are a sectary; That's the plain truth.",
"My Lord of Winchester, y'are a little, By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble, However faulty, yet should find respect For what they have been; 'tis a cruelty To load a falling man.",
"Good Master Secretary, I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst   Of all this table, say so.",
"Why, my lord?",
"Do not I know you for a favourer Of this new sect?",
"Not sound?",
"Not sound, I say.",
"Would you were half so honest!",
"I shall remember this bold language.",
"Do.",
"This is too much; Forbear, for shame, my lords.",
"I have done.",
"And I.",
"Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed, I take it, by all voices, that forthwith You be convey'd to th' Tower a prisoner; There to remain till the King's further pleasure Be known unto us.",
"We are.",
"Is there no other way of mercy, But I must needs to th' Tower, my lords?",
"What other Would you expect?",
"For me?",
"Receive him, And see him safe i' th' Tower.",
"Stay, good my lords, I have a little yet to say.",
"This is the King's ring.",
"'Tis no counterfeit.",
"'Tis the right ring, by heav'n.",
"Do you think, my lords, The King will suffer but the little finger Of this man to be vex'd?",
"'Tis now too certain; How much more is his life in value with him!",
"My mind gave me, In seeking tales and informations Against this man-whose honesty the devil And his disciples only envy at- Ye blew the fire that burns ye.",
"Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince; Not only good and wise but most religious;   One that in all obedience makes the church The chief aim of his honour and, to strengthen That holy duty, out of dear respect, His royal self in judgment comes to hear The cause betwixt her and this great offender.",
"You were ever good at sudden commendations, Bishop of Winchester.",
"May it please your Grace-",
"No, sir, it does not please me.",
"Thus far, My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace To let my tongue excuse all.",
"Well, well, my lords, respect him;   Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.",
"The greatest monarch now alive may glory In such an honour; how may I deserve it, That am a poor and humble subject to you?",
"Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your spoons.",
"With a true heart And brother-love I do it.",
"And let heaven Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.",
"Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart.",
"You'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals.",
"Belong to th' gallows, and be hang'd, ye rogue!",
"Pray, sir, be patient; 'tis as much impossible, Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons, To scatter 'em as 'tis to make 'em sleep On May-day morning; which will never be.",
"How got they in, and be hang'd?",
"Alas, I know not: how gets the tide in?",
"You did nothing, sir.",
"I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand, To mow 'em down before me; but if I spar'd any That had a head to hit, either young or old, He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker, Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again; And that I would not for a cow, God save her!",
"I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.",
"What would you have me do?",
"What should you do, but knock 'em down by th' dozens?",
"The spoons will be the bigger, sir.",
"These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse and fight for bitten apples; that no audience but the of Tower-hill or the limbs of Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.",
"Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!",
"An't please your honour, We are but men; and what so many may do, Not being torn a pieces, we have done.",
"As I live, If the King blame me for't, I'll lay ye an By th' heels, and suddenly; and on your heads Clap round fines for neglect.",
"Make way there for the Princess.",
"You great fellow, Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.",
"You i' th' camlet, get up o' th' rail; I'll peck you o'er the pales else.",
"Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous life, long and ever-happy, to the high and mighty Princess of England, Elizabeth!",
"[Kneeling]  And to your royal Grace and the My noble partners and myself thus pray: All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady, Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy, May hourly fall upon ye!",
"Thank you, good Lord Archbishop.",
"Elizabeth.",
"Stand up, lord.",
"Amen.",
"My noble gossips, y'have been too prodigal; I thank ye heartily.",
"Let me speak, sir, For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.",
"Thou speakest wonders.",
"She shall be, to the happiness of England,   An aged princess; many days shall see her, And yet no day without a deed to crown it.",
"O Lord Archbishop, Thou hast made me now a man; never before This happy child did I get anything.",
"The End.",
