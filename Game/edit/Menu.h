/* Menu
 *
 * This structure provides a general way of displaying a directory hierarchy in the editor.
 * This Menu is displayed using EditListView, specifcations of which can be found in the  
 * appropriate header file.  Allows for opening of directories by left-clicking, and allows
 * for an arbitrary function to be run upon clicking a particular entry.
 *
 ********************
 *
 * Creating a new menu:
 * Menu * myMenu = newMenu(x,y,width,height,name);
 *
 * x and y are the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the menu
 *
 * width and height are the width and height of the active region of the menu 
 * (i.e. the area that can be clicked).
 *
 * name is the name of the root directory, "/", and has no function except that 
 * it is shown when displayed on the screen.
 *
 *********************
 *
 * Adding entries to a menu:
 * addEntryToMenu(myMenu,path,function,info);
 *
 * myMenu is the pointer to your menu.
 *
 * path is a string that describes the new Entry, "dir/subdir/entry", for example.
 * Adding that path would automatically add "dir" and "dur/subdir", so it is not 
 * necessary to add each directory, it suffices to add any of its children.  Adding
 * any path twice will have no effect.
 *
 * function is a function pointer to a function of the form: void (*func)(MenuEntry * me,ClickInfo * ci);
 * the function will be called whenever this newly added entry is clicked, and it will be passed the
 * MenuEntry that was clicked, as well as info, which can be a pointer to any arbitrary data.
 * function can be NULL, in which case no function will be run when this path is clicked in the Menu.
 *
 *********************
 *
 * Displaying the menu:
 * displayMenu(myMenu);
 *
 * myMenu is the pointer to your menu, and it is displayed using EditListView's display code.
 *
 * all mouse event handling occurs within this function by EditListView code.
 *
 *********************
 *
 * Removing entries from a menu:
 * deleteEntryFromMenu(myMenu,path);
 * 
 * myMenu is the pointer to your Menu
 *
 * path is the path of the entry you are removing.  Removing a path will also automatically remove
 * any entry that is a child of that path.  So removing "a/b" will remove "a/b/c", for example.
 *
 *********************
 *
 * Destroying the menu:
 * destroyMenu(myMenu);
 *
 * myMenu is the pointer to your Menu, and it and all its entries will be destroyed.  There is 
 * no need to remove entries before calling this function, it will remove and free all memory properly.
 *
